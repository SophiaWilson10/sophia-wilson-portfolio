## Professional Self-Assessment

My journey through the Computer Science program has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Building this ePortfolio gave me the opportunity to reflect on how much I have grown, both as a developer and as a professional. Each course added a new layer of knowledge, and the enhancements completed for my capstone helped me see how these skills come together to form a strong technical foundation. Throughout the program, I learned how to think like a software engineer, communicate effectively with diverse audiences, and approach problems with a focus on security, efficiency, and user experience.

Collaboration became a central part of my development. Courses that emphasized Agile practices, peer reviews, and project planning taught me the importance of clear communication and teamwork. I learned how to explain technical concepts to nontechnical stakeholders, listen carefully to requirements, and justify design decisions with confidence. These skills became increasingly important in advanced courses where projects required thoughtful planning, documentation, and presentation.

Data structures and algorithms challenged me to think critically about performance and design tradeoffs. I learned how different structures affect efficiency and memory usage, and how to balance clean, readable code with optimized solutions. Applying these principles in later projects helped me understand their real-world value beyond theory.

Software engineering and database development played a major role in my growth. Through courses such as CS340, CS360, CS330, and CS465, I gained hands-on experience building full stack applications, integrating front-end and back-end logic, and designing databases that support scalable and maintainable systems. Working with MongoDB, Room Database, MySQL, and RESTful APIs strengthened my understanding of how data flows across an application. My artifact enhancements reflect this progress through improved structure, modularity, expanded functionality, and stronger database integration.

Security became a core mindset rather than an afterthought. Through secure coding practices, encryption, hashing, and authentication work, I learned how to identify potential vulnerabilities and design systems to prevent them. Implementing JWT authentication, validating input, and reviewing code for security risks helped me understand the responsibility developers have to protect users and data.

This ePortfolio brings everything together and tells my story as a computer science graduate. Each artifact represents a different area of expertise, and each enhancement demonstrates how I elevated earlier work to a more professional level. Together, they showcase my ability to solve complex problems, design clean and maintainable code, test and debug effectively, build meaningful user experiences, and secure the systems I create.

This program has helped shape my professional goals and solidified my interests in software engineering, mobile development, databases, and UI and UX design. I enjoy building applications that are both functional and intuitive. I now feel prepared to enter the industry with confidence, supported by a strong technical foundation, a portfolio that reflects my growth, and a clear vision for continued learning and professional development.
