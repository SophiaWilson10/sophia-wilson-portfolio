## Code Review

This section contains my informal code review video, which examines the original versions of the artifacts included in this portfolio prior to enhancement.

The review provides a walkthrough of each project and evaluates the existing code across multiple areas of computer science, including software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database integration.

### Review Focus
The code review is organized around the following themes:
- Walkthrough of original functionality for each artifact  
- Evaluation of code structure, organization, and maintainability  
- Identification of algorithmic and data-handling considerations  
- Review of database usage and efficiency  
- Discussion of design limitations and opportunities for improvement  

### Code Review Video
The unlisted video below documents the condition of each artifact before enhancement and explains the reasoning behind the planned improvements that were later implemented throughout this portfolio.
